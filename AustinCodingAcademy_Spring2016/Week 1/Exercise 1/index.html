                <li>No</li>
                <li>Good</li>
            </ul>
        <p>started making trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight, my mom got scared and said "You're moving in with your Auntie and Uncle in Bel Air."</p>

        <p>I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistling" target="blank">whistled</a> for a cab, and when it came near, the license plate said "fresh" and it had dice in the mirror.</p>

        <p>If anything, I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought, "Nah, forget it. Yo homes, to Bel Air!"</p>

        <p>I pulled up to the house about 7:00 or 8:00 and I yelled to the cabbie "Yo homes, smell ya later!" I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there, to sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.</p>
